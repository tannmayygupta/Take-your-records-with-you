# read-sightings

A command-line reader for Deccan Birders journals. It was written from
[`FORMAT.md`](../../FORMAT.md) alone and imports nothing from this repository, only
`@noble/hashes` (keccak256) and `@noble/curves` (to check who signed the journal
pointer). It is the proof that a fourth app, one nobody on the project wrote, can
read the records.

```sh
node read-sightings.mjs --owner 0x<journal address>
node read-sightings.mjs --owner 0x<journal address> --photos ./photos --json
node read-sightings.mjs --journal <journal reference>
node read-sightings.mjs --record <sighting reference> --gateway http://localhost:1633
node read-sightings.mjs --owner 0x<journal address> --dwc > sightings.csv
node read-sightings.mjs --owner 0x<journal address> --dwc --out sightings.csv
```

`--dwc` prints the sightings as a Darwin Core occurrence CSV (FORMAT.md §7), ready for GBIF or a
spreadsheet; warnings and records that could not be read go to stderr, so the CSV stays clean.
The mapping is this file's own copy, since the tool imports nothing from the repository;
`tests/dwc-parity.test.ts` checks it against `packages/format` and the golden file
`packages/format/fixtures/dwc/expected.csv`.

The default endpoint is the public gateway, `https://api.gateway.ethswarm.org`.
Any Bee API endpoint works.

What it checks, from FORMAT.md: each feed update's identifier and 40-byte span, who signed it
(it warns unless that is the address you asked for), that the journal's `owner` and `sequence`
agree with the feed, each document's `format`, MAJOR version and required fields, and each
photo's length against the record's `byteLength` before saving it. A record that fails is
listed with its reason; the others still print.
